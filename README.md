# The Sonic Mania

Just a little project I did around Sonic to try my hand on class, methods, routing, controllers, data base, etc.

## Update 19.05.22

I manage to position the nav as I intended originaly using flex-box.

## Next Update

I will maybe transform it in one page rather than having a second page for the creator.
And I want to put the nav on absolute.
